# cximage-unix

Computer vision library for CPP.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer ⚠️

I'm not the original creator of this library, all credits go to Davide Pizzolato and his original [codeproject article](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1300/CxImage).

I just modified some files to make it compatible with linux/unix/macos systems.
